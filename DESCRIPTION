Authors@R: person("Danail", "Obreschkow", email = "danail.obreschkow@icrar.org", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package can fit analytical galaxy mass functions, such as the famous Schechter function, to a list of galaxies with mass measurements. Unlike most common fitting approaches, this method is independent of binning, accounts for measurement uncertainties and non-detections, and yields well-defined parameter uncertainties.
