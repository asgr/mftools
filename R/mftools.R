#' Fitting mass and luminosity functions
#'
#' \pkg{mftools} optimally fits galaxy mass functions (MFs) to a set of astronomical data points with/without measurement uncertainties. No binning of the data is used in the fitting. The package can also be used to fit related functions such as halo MFs and luminosity functions.
#'
#' The functions you're most likely to need from \pkg{mftools} are \code{\link{mffit}} and
#' \code{\link{mfplot}}. See the documentation of these functions for details.
